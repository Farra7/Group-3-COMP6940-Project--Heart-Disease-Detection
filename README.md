# Group-3-COMP6940-Project--Heart-Disease-Detection
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (or heart diseases) are common amongst many Caribbean nationals and are the main cause of death for many in the region. Many are unaware that they have CVD until a catastrophic event has taken place, by which it may be too late to act . Advances in technology now make it possible to use machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the likelihood of CVD in humans allowing us to take more proactive measures. This project aims to connect CVD detection and wearable technology by utilising data that could be collected from smart devices. This study uses Random Forest, Logistic Regression (Multinomial), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes algorithms to predict CVD. The dataset used in this study was merged from two separate kaggle datasets which consisted of attributes such as age, sex and heart disease.
This project seeks to bridge the gap between wearable technology and heart disease detection using different machine learning algorithms.
